## What a great achievement!

We have:

- created a HTML document (page)
- created a form within the web page
- coded a variety of HTML tags
- coded a variety of HTML form controls
- used attributes on HTML tags to customise the tags

## Table of Contents

We started with great expectations to create a HTML web page with a form and related controls and now having reached the end of the scenario we can see that we have stepped through the following stages  

1. creating a basic Hypertext Markup Language document with a form within it
2. adding input boxes to the form.
3. adding an input control of type select to the form.
4. adding an input control of type range to the form.
5. adding an input of type number to the form.
6. adding radio buttons to the form.
7. adding checkboxes to the form.
8. adding date inputs to the form.
9. adding a submit button to the form.

to produce the final form.

## Further Learning

Now we have an initial understanding of HTML we should think about:

- learning more about HTML
- learn about Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). There will be a scenario for CSS that continues from the HTML we have just completed.
- learn about JavaScript. There will be a scenario for JavaScript that continues from the HTML we have just completed.
