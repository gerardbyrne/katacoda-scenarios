# What a great achievement :congratulations: :smiley:

We have:

- created a HTML document (page) :white_check_mark:
- created a form within the web page :white_check_mark:
- coded a variety of HTML tags :white_check_mark:
- coded a variety of HTML form controls :white_check_mark:
- used attributes on HTML tags to customise the tags :white_check_mark:

## Table of Contents

We started with great expectations to create a HTML web page with a form and related controls and now having reached the end of the scenario we can see that we have stepped through the following stages:

1. creating a basic Hypertext Markup Language document with a form within it. :white_check_mark:
2. adding input boxes to the form. :white_check_mark:
3. adding an input control of type select to the form. :white_check_mark:
4. adding an input control of type range to the form. :white_check_mark:
5. adding an input of type number to the form. :white_check_mark:
6. adding radio buttons to the form. :white_check_mark:
7. adding checkboxes to the form. :white_check_mark:
8. adding date inputs to the form. :white_check_mark:
9. adding a submit button to the form. :white_check_mark:

to produce the final form.

## Further Learning

Now we have an initial understanding of HTML we should think about:

- learning more about HTML
- learn about Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). There will be a scenario for CSS that continues from the HTML we have just completed.
- learn about JavaScript. There will be a scenario for JavaScript that continues from the HTML we have just completed.
